## Non-Functional Requirements


### 1. Performance Requirements

 - The system shall process forensic evidence efficiently without excessive delay   (Tech stack: Optimized Python processing, asynchronous backend APIs).

 - The system shall support concurrent analysis requests.

 - The system shall handle large datasets reliably.


### 2. Security Requirements

 - The system shall ensure confidentiality of forensic evidence   (Tech stack: HTTPS, TLS).

 - The system shall encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit   (Tech stack: AES encryption, secure database storage).

 - The system shall protect against unauthorized access   (Tech stack: JWT authentication, role-based authorization).


### 3. Reliability

 - The system shall be reliable and fault-tolerant   (Tech stack: Backend exception handling, logging).

 - The system shall recover gracefully from failures.

 - The system shall prevent data loss during unexpected shutdowns.


### 4. Usability

 - The system shall provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface   (Tech stack: React.js, responsive UI design).

 - The system shall provide clear feedback during evidence upload and analysis.


### 5. Scalability

 - The system shall support future expansion to additional forensic datasets   (Tech stack: Modular backend architecture).

 - The system shall allow integration of new ML models without major redesign.


### 6. Maintainability

 - The system shall be modular and easy to maintain   (Tech stack: RESTful APIs, modular code structure).

 - The system shall support independent updates to datasets and ML models.


### 7. Legal and Ethical Requirements

 - The system shall preserve forensic soundness of evidence.

 - The system shall follow standard digital forensic guidelines.
