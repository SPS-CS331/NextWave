# Use Case Diagram (UCD) in Software Engineering

A Use Case Diagram (UCD) is a type of UML diagram used in Software Engineering to represent:

- Who uses the system (called **Actors**)
- What the system can do (called **Use Cases**)
- How users interact with different features of the system

---

## Why Use Case Diagrams are Used

Use Case Diagrams help in:

- Understanding the system requirements clearly  
- Showing the system from the user’s point of view  
- Identifying all possible interactions between users and the system  
- Making communication easier between developers and clients

## Main Parts of a Use Case Diagram

### Actor
An actor is a person or an external system that interacts with the software.

Examples: Student, Admin, User, ATM Machine  
It is usually shown using a stick figure.

### Use Case
A use case represents a function or service provided by the system.

Examples: Login, Register, Upload File  
It is drawn using an oval shape.

### System Boundary
The system boundary is a rectangle that contains all the use cases and shows the scope of the system.

### Relationships
- **Association** – Connection between an actor and a use case  
- **Include** – One use case always uses another (`<<include>>`)  
- **Extend** – Optional or additional behavior (`<<extend>>`)  
- **Generalization** – Inheritance between actors or use cases

## Example: Online Library System

### Actors
- Student  
- Librarian  

### Use Cases
- Search Book  
- Issue Book  
- Return Book  
- Login  
- Manage Books  

### Interactions
- Student can Search Book and Issue Book  
- Librarian can Issue Book, Return Book, and Manage Books

## Important Points

- UCD stands for Use Case Diagram  
- It is a **behavioral UML diagram**  
- It shows **what the system does**, not how it is implemented  
- It mainly represents the **functional requirements** of the system
