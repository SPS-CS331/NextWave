USE CASE DIAGRAM (UCD)

A Use Case Diagram shows:
- Who uses the system (Actors)
- What the system can do (Use Cases)
- How users interact with the system

Why Use Case Diagram is used:
- To understand system requirements
- To view the system from user side
- To identify all system functions
- To improve communication between client and developer

Main Parts:

1. Actor
An actor is a person or another system that uses the software.
Example: Student, Admin, User, ATM
Shown as a stick figure.

2. Use Case
A use case is a function of the system.
Example: Login, Register, Upload File
Shown as an oval.

3. System Boundary
A rectangle that contains all use cases and shows the system scope.

4. Relationships
- Association: Link between actor and use case
- Include: One use case always uses another
- Extend: Optional extra functionality
- Generalization: Parent-child relationship

Example: Online Library System

Actors:
- Student
- Librarian

Use Cases:
- Search Book
- Issue Book
- Return Book
- Login
- Manage Books

Interactions:
- Student can Search Book and Issue Book
- Librarian can Issue Book, Return Book and Manage Books

Key Points:
- UCD stands for Use Case Diagram
- It is a UML diagram
- It shows what the system does
- It represents functional requirements, not implementation
