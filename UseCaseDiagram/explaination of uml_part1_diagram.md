### System Boundary

The large rectangle represents the system boundary, which defines the scope of the Automated Digital Forensics Evidence Collection and Analysis System.
All use cases inside this boundary are functionalities provided by the system, while the actors are external entities interacting with it.

### Actors and Their Responsibilities

1. System Administrator
The System Administrator is responsible for managing and maintaining the system.

#### Associated Use Cases:

 - Login
Allows the administrator to securely access the system.

 - Manage Users
Enables the administrator to add, remove, or update user accounts and assign roles.

 - Manage Datasets and Models
Allows configuration and maintenance of forensic datasets and machine learning models used for analysis.

 - Monitor System Logs
Enables the administrator to monitor system activity and audit logs for security and compliance purposes.

#### These use cases ensure proper system control, security, and operational integrity.

2. Forensic Investigator

The Forensic Investigator is responsible for collecting evidence and reviewing investigation outcomes.

#### Associated Use Cases:

 - Login
Allows the investigator to authenticate and access the system.

 - Upload Evidence
Enables the investigator to submit digital evidence such as files, images, videos, or logs.

 - Select Evidence Type
Allows the investigator to specify the category or type of uploaded evidence for proper handling.

 - Review Reports
Enables the investigator to view forensic analysis reports generated by the system.

 - View Chain of Custody
Allows the investigator to examine the complete history of evidence handling, ensuring authenticity and legal validity.

These use cases support evidence collection, verification, and investigation review.

### Relationships Shown in the Diagram

 - Association relationships (solid lines) connect actors to use cases, indicating direct interaction.

 - Both actors interact with the Login use case, showing that authentication is required for system access.

 - Each actor is connected only to the use cases relevant to their role, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities.

### Purpose of This Diagram Section

This part of the UML diagram focuses on:

 - User authentication

 - Evidence submission

 - Evidence review and traceability

#### Administrative system control

It demonstrates how different users interact with the system while maintaining security, accountability, and forensic integrity.
